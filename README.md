# 30 Rock Clicky Game
This weeks assignment was to create a memory game with React. It required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. 
​
## Getting Started: 
To begin the game, a user must click on an image of a character from the show 30 Rock. Once a character is clicked, the remaining images are shuffled. A user score is incremented by 1 for every different character clicked, but resets to zero if the same one is clicked twice. Once the game resets and the user starts playing again, it will keep track of their highest score.

## App Example:

</a>

## Technologies Used:
-   React
-   CSS
-   Bootstrap
-   Google Fonts
-   GitHub

## Future Enhancements:
In the future, I'd like to update my React code by creating a separate Game component folder/files to import into the App.js to clean up the code.
